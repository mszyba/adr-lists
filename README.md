# ADR List
## Introduction
The purpose of the app is creating documentation of road transport of dangerous goods
for employees, which for various reasons have to participate
in the generation and verification of the delivery notes.
This application allows you to significantly reduce the time needed to generate a document and what the most important,
you don't need to be an ADR specialist, you have to just enter the appropriate data and
the document will be generated in accordance with the law.
The entered data is also used to prepare the annual report.

I wanted to be created this application, because of my 10 years work experience with dangerous goods transports. I could use my previous knowledge about ADR and my new skills in the field of programming.
